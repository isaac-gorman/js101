   Overview: 
    Q: What will I cover in this assignment?
    - A: I will add some more debugging methods to my tool box.
         When dealing with more complex programs its more important to know how to identify a and eliminate bugs when the occur. 

         I will become a little more familiar with the debugger

   Review: 
    Q: What are the basic commands for the debugger, and concepts that I have already covered? 
    - A: 
         Calm Patient Temperament: Think Spock from Star Trek.   
         Bugs are just apart of the process, develop a clam problem solving personality 
         and mentality.
         
         Stack Trace:
         Become very used to reading the stack trace. The stack trace is the text that shows up on my screen when I make an error in my code. 

         Common Error 
         - Syntax Error 
         - Variable Doesn't Exist 
         - TypeErrors when you call a method on a value that it is not a prototype of

   Executing Expression Functions: 
    Q: What is the exec command?
    - A: The exec command is a node debugger command for executing the code you want
         to trouble shoot.

         The exec command is a way for accessing in-scope variables within the debugger. 
         Fun fact: Did you know that the exec command can be used to evaluate expressions
         or execute functions
    
    Q: How do actually use exec command again?
    - A: Go to the terminal and type `node inspect <file.js>`

    Q: What do I need in order to execute a function with the exec key word?
    - A: In order to execute with the exec command I need to have an actual invocation
         for that function in my code, not just the function definition. 

    Q: What is another way to evaluate expressions or execute functions?

   Setting and Clearing Breakpoints:
    Q: How have I learned to set up breakpoint in my code so far?

    Q: How can I add or remove breakpoint as it is running within the debugger?

    Q: What is setBreakpoint() / sb()?

    Q: What is clearBreakpoint() / cb()?

   Stepping Into Functions:
    Q: How would I step through function as of now?

    Q: When reaching the inner function invocation how would I move into the execution of that function, rather than just moving over to the next expression? Why is this useful?

   Other Commands:
    Q: What are some other useful commands when trouble shooting code?

    Q: What does the help() command do?

    Q: What does the list() command do?
