    Decomposing the Problem: 
    Q: Before we start coding what must we do first, when first introduced with a new problem? 
    - A: I must really understand the problem that I am being 
         asked to solve. 

         I must understand the problem, then design a mental model of the solution sometimes in the form of a flowchart.

         But in order to accomplish this I must work backwards to break down the problem to several sub-problems. A good first step is to describe the problem in your own words, then move on to construct a high-level flow chart. 

    Q: Describe the game of tic-tac-toe: 
    - Tic-Tac-Toe
         2 player-game
         Played on a 3 x 3 grid called the board
         Each player take a turn marking there square on the board
         First player to get three 





    Q: What are the rule so of tic-tac-toe?

    Q: What is the generic sequence of the game? 

    Q: What do the main two loops do with the function do? 

    Q: What is crucial when breaking down a problem breaking down the problem initially? 

    Flowchart: 

    construct you flowchart for the game
