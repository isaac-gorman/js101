// Selection and Transformation

/* Q: Besides iterations what are the two most common actions done on collection?
   
   - 1. Selection 
   - 2. Transformation

*/

/* Q: What is a selection? 

   A: Selection is the process of extracting a particular element from a collection based on particular requirements. 

   A: In other words selection is selecting one or more elements form a collection depending on specific requirements. 

*/

/* Q: What is an example of selection on a collection? 

   A: Examples: 
   - Picking all the odd numbers in an array 
   - Extracting all of the pet_type: dog form an object for an animal shelter
*/

/* Q: What is transformation? 

   A: Transformation is the alteration (mutation) of every element in the collection.


*/

/* Q: What are some examples of transformation?

   A: Examples: 
   - Incrementing every integer in an array by 1
   - Charging every user in a subscription to pending_charge as true in an object


*/

/* Q: In relation to N elements in a collection what is important to understand about selections and transformation?

   Transformations: 
   - If there are N elements in a collection than N elements will be mutated 

   Selections: 
   - If there are N elements in a collection N elements or less will be selected

*/

/* Q: What is the secrete sauce? 

   A: The secrete sauce is the fact that you can do almost anything imaginable to a collection utilizing selections and transformations. 

   A: The fluency of utilizing these two actions enable you to become very useful when using collections. 

*/

/* Q: What are the 4 key features of looping and other features that selection and transformations have in common?

   1. Loops
   2. Counters
   3. A way to retrieve the current value 
   4. A way to exit the loop 

   - Both selections and transformation require specified criteria that determine the results 
        - Selections need criteria in order to determine what elements or elements to select 
        - Transformations need criteria in order to determine what elements to transform (mutate)


*/

/* Q: What makes selection and transformations different? 
    
   A: They use criteria to determine different actions, selection use criteria to select while, transformations use criteria to transform elements
